# Getting Started with Full Stack Book Inventory Management

## Backend

Backend project implemented using Amplify & Lambda & DynamoDB

### AWS Amplify is a JavaScript library for frontend and mobile developers building cloud-enabled applications
AWS Amplify provides a declarative and easy-to-use interface across different categories of cloud operations. AWS Amplify goes well with any JavaScript based frontend workflow and React Native for mobile developers.

I used Amplify Studio and Amplify Cli for configuring Backend and also creating APIs and Lambda for creating API function 
and configured API to integrate with dynamoDB for CRUD operations

# Scripts to run the frontend project

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
